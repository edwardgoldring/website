# Biography

I am a US-Asia Grand Strategy Predoctoral Fellow at the University of Southern California, a Korea Foundation Fellow, and I expect to receive my PhD in Political Science from the University of Missouri in May 2020. I study political violence, especially how non-democratic leaders maintain power.

My dissertation examines the causes of elite purges in dictatorships. My central contention is that a dictator's fear of being unseated by popular protests and foreign adversaries shapes whether to purge elites, who to target, and when to do so. Conversely, existing arguments emphasize how the coup threat informs a dictator's decision to purge. The theory's cross-national and individual-level implications necessitate a diverse set of data and empirical tests. I use a range of national and individual-level quantitative and qualitative original data, including individual-level quantitative data on elite politics in Kim Jong Un's North Korea.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in journals including *Comparative Political Studies*, *Journal of Peace Research*, *Party Politics*, *Democratization*, and *Research & Politics*.
