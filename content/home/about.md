# Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Division of Social Science at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

I study authoritarianism, with a focus on East Asia. My book manuscript, *Elite Purges in Dictatorships*, examines the causes of elite purges and their effects on autocratic survival. My central claim is that a dictator's fear of being unseated by popular protests and foreign adversaries shapes whether they purge elites, who to target, and when to do so. Conversely, existing arguments emphasize how coup threats shape patterns of elite purges.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in journals including *Comparative Political Studies*, *Journal of Peace Research*, *Party Politics*, *Democratization*, and *Research & Politics*.
