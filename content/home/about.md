# Biography

I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of Missouri. My research examines authoritarian survival politics. I have further research interests in democratization, election manipulation, and peacekeeping. I use qualitative and quantitative methods including spatial econometrics.

My dissertation examines the causes of elite purges in dictatorships. I argue that at the national and individual-levels, dictators' incentives and opportunities shape variation in elite purges. Across regimes, dictators take advantage of reduced non-elite-based threats to purge their ruling coalition. Across individuals within dictatorships, signals of disloyalty incentivize dictators to purge elites and they are more likely to act on such signals when they are in a more secure position. Furthermore, dictators use purges as a heuristic to identify further disloyal individuals and conduct additional purges. I test my theory with original cross-national quantitative data on elite purges, a pair of qualitative case studies on China (1978-89) and South Korea (1963-79), and individual-level quantitative data on Kim Jong Un's North Korea.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in journals including *Party Politics*, *Democratization*, *Research & Politics*, and *Africa Spectrum*.
