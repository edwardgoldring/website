# Biography

I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of Missouri. My research examines how authoritarian survival politics. I have further research interests in democratization, election manipulation, and peacekeeping. I use qualitative and quantitative methods including spatial econometrics. My dissertation examines the causes of purges in dictatorships.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in journals including *Party Politics*, *Democratization*, *Research & Politics*, and *Africa Spectrum*.
