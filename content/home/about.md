# Biography

I am a Lecturer in Political Science (Comparative Politics) at the [University of Melbourne](https://arts.unimelb.edu.au/school-of-social-and-political-sciences). I study authoritarian politics, mainly from a global comparative perspective, and have a particular interest in North Korea.

I am currently working on two main projects. First, a book manuscript, *Purges: How Dictators Fight to Survive*, examines the causes and effects of elite purges. I argue that dictators purge elites to consolidate power, punish insubordination, and scapegoat them to alleviate popular threats. Rather than fomenting instability, purges help dictators survive. Second, I am working on a project about how dictators manage elites to facilitate succession, which uses quantitative and qualitative data from North Korea.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in journals including *British Journal of Political Science*, *Comparative Political Studies*, *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, and *World Politics*.
