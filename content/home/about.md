# Biography

I am am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Department of Politics at the University of York. I study authoritarian politics, mainly from a global comparative perspective but sometimes focus especially on North Korea.

My book manuscript, *Purges: A Dictator's Fight to Survive*, examines the causes of elite purges and their effects on autocratic survival. I argue that threats to a dictator's survival from the people and foreign states affect patterns of purges, and that rather than fomenting instability, purges help dictators survive.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in journals including *British Journal of Political Science*, *Comparative Political Studies*, *Journal of Peace Research*, and *Democratization*.
