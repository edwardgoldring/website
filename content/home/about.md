# Biography

I am a Senior Lecturer in Political Science (Comparative Politics) at the [University of Melbourne](https://arts.unimelb.edu.au/school-of-social-and-political-sciences). I study authoritarian politics, mainly from a global comparative perspective, but I also have a particular interest in North Korea.

My research primarily examines how autocratic leaders and regimes maintain power. My main ongoing projects are on purges and succession under autocracy.

My work on these topics, and on related areas of autocratic politics, has been published or is forthcoming in outlets including the *British Journal of Political Science*, *Comparative Political Studies*, *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, *Perspectives on Politics*, *World Politics*, and with Cambridge and Cornell University Presses.
