# Biography

I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of Missouri. My research examines how autocratic leaders maintain and lose power, and I have case expertise in North Korea. I have further research interests in democratization, election manipulation, and peacekeeping. My dissertation explores purges in authoritarian regimes, looking at when leaders decide to purge and various effects of purges.

My work has been published or is forthcoming in journals including *Party Politics*, *Democratization*, *Research & Politics*, and *Africa Spectrum*.
