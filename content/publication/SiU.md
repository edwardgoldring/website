abstract = "As Uganda's President Museveni ages, and his governance strategy of divide-and-rule continues to fragment and weaken alternatives to his leadership, succession has become an increasingly salient topic for Ugandans. Even as he has continually teased retirement, Museveni shows no sign of leaving power and has refused to name a successor. The stakes are high: Uganda has never experienced a peaceful leadership transition, and in a context of entrenched patrimonial rule, the next leader may dictate distribution of state resources for decades to come. Amid this ambiguity, Museveni's son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, has repeatedly emerged as the most likely successor. But Muhoozi is widely seen as erratic and unpresidential---characteristics that could spell trouble in Uganda's electoral authoritarian regime, where citizens retain the expectation of regular elections, and where loyalty at the ballot box for an unpopular candidate entails costly payouts and intimidation. In this context, we fielded two surveys between November 2024 and January 2025 to assess Muhoozi's popularity among Ugandan citizens. We find that Museveni enjoys significantly greater support than Muhoozi across the country. If Muhoozi does succeed Museveni, he faces a challenge to ensure the continued stability of Uganda's electoral autocratic regime."
