abstract = "What should students interested in authoritarian politics learn? How can instructors communicate these ideas to students? And how can instructors navigate the ethical challenges of teaching about autocracy? In response to these questions, Teaching Autocracy and Autocratic Politics provides practical support for instructors regarding course content, teaching tools, and ethical questions. Authoritarianism is the world’s primary form of government. While research on the subject has flourished, there is minimal material on teaching about autocracy. This edited volume provides the first in-depth examination of how we can teach about autocracy."
